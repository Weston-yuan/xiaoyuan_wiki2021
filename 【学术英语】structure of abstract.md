**eg. Abstract**  
 [1] The speed of sound in a fluid is determined by, and therefore an indicator of, the thermodynamic properties of that fluid. [2] The aim of this study was to investigate the use of an ultrasonic cell to determine crude oil properties, in particular oil density. [3] An ultrasonic cell was constructed to measure the speed of sound and tested in a crude oil sample.[a]The speed of sound was measured at temperatures between 260 and 411 K at pressures up to 75 MPs. [4] The measurements were shown to lead to an accurate determination of the bubble point of the oil. [5] This indicates that there is a possibility of obtaining fluid density from sound speed measurements and suggests that it is possible to measure sound absorption with an ultrasonic cell to determine oil viscosity.
